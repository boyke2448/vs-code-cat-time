# vs-code-cat-time README

You need a break when coding? I believe... it's cat time. Silly VS Code

## Usage

Install the extension "Cat time" from the vs code market place or the extensions panel in vs code.
Then press Ctrl-P and enter the command "Cat time".

A new window will open with a random cat gif from giphy.
